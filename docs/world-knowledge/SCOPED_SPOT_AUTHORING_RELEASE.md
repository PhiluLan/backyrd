# Scoped spot authoring release

Admin and Owner share linked offering and area cards, scoped prices and schedules,
category-specific detail questions, draft reuse of existing claims and a shared
product vocabulary. Human review precedes submission. Missing knowledge remains
unknown. Existing claims, moderation, consent, RLS and append-only history remain
authoritative.

The release includes the prerequisite World registry versions 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.
The existing Decision resolver bridge accepts these alongside historical 2.1
projections. The experimental Luna/Bibliothekar runtime, model/prompt changes,
conversation schema and Mobile updates are outside this release.

Production publication requires the repository's clean database bootstrap,
authorization tests, Admin/Web builds, risk gate and source-bound release artifact.
Migration activation is separate from UI build success. No synthetic data is
written to production for verification.
